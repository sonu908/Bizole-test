# Validation Implementation
To ensure data integrity and enhance user experience, I implemented validation functionalities using React libraries. These libraries provided robust validation features that helped me streamline the input verification process and prevent erroneous data submission. By incorporating these libraries, I was able to improve the overall quality and reliability of the user input.

# Some of the React libraries I used for validation are:

## Yup-
Yup is a powerful schema validation library that I integrated with React Hook Form. It enabled me to define validation rules and error messages in a concise and declarative manner.
## Formik-
Formik is another popular library that I utilized to manage form state and validation. It offered a convenient way to handle form submission, validation, and error handling.
